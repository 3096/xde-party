# XDE Party Editor
A quick homebrew app for editing Xenoblade DE party member in the save file. It's only for my personal use, so it's not something of release quality. It'll only use a save from Atmosphere's save redirect dir.

Note: the game crashes because it cannot handle party members with no weapon equipped, so you need to [patch your game](/patch/xde.pchtxt) to avoid that.
